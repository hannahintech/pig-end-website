Sara is also an accomplished craftswoman with a special interest in textiles, traditional costumes and human figures. She has an extensive collection of arts and crafts from her travels.

                Both from engineering backgrounds, one of us from Poland and one from the UK, we have been working, learning and exploring the world together for eighteen years. After many adventures in Europe, Africa and Asia, we chose to settle permanently in the lovely land of Lower Silesia in Poland, in the former Lausitz, at the border triangle of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Inspired by our experiences and the people we met we have brought back many ideas, handicrafts and curiostities to join with the rich cultures and traditions of the local area. With all these influences in mind we have lovingly prepared rooms for our guests in The Mill House Włosień. You can experience a taste of India, China, and Eastern Europe inside a building that has been restored with every respect for local tradition.

                        The Mill House Włosień was built as a watermill in 1827 in Upper Lusitania under German administration in the village of Nieder Heidersdorf or Heydenreichsdorf in the district of Lauban.

                    <p>
                        After the Second World War this district, now known as Luban, became part of Poland, and the village was re-named Włosień. The building became a private home and the mill fell into disrepair. Since we moved to a farmhouse nearby we had fallen in love with the mill. When the occupants decided to move to the town we leapt at the opportunity to fulfil our dream of renovating it as a guest house and to share the beautiful building with as many people as we could. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The renovation brought many surprises. It turned out that under the old grey plaster was a fabulously colourful stone building constructed in sandstone, basalt and slate. We have used local reclaimed and traditional materials to preserve the original appearance of the building. As well as modern conveniences traditional features include a ceramic solid fuel oven in the kitchen and restored ceramic tiled stove in the living room.
