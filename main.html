            <h3 id="h3-sec-one">Our History</h3>
            <p id="text-sec-one">
            Both from engineering backgrounds, one of us from Poland and one from the UK, we have been working, learning and exploring the world together for eighteen years. After many adventures in Europe, Africa and Asia, we chose to settle permanently in the lovely land of Lower Silesia in Poland, in the former Lausitz, at the border triangle of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Inspired by our experiences and the people we met we have brought back many ideas, handicrafts and curiostities to join with the rich cultures and traditions of the local area. With all these influences in mind we have lovingly prepared rooms for our guests in The Mill House Włosień. You can experience a taste of India, China, and Eastern Europe inside a building that has been restored with every respect for local tradition.

            Rest in a beautiful and unique setting where three borders meet - Polish, German and Czech -  in the village of Włosień in a lovingly restored two hundred year old water mill.<br>
            Włosień is located in Platerowka, the smallest gmina (parish) in Poland. Platerowka is named after the national heroine Countess Emilia Plater (1806-1831), countess and captain in the Polish Revolutionary Army. After the Second World War the soldiers from the women’s battalion named after Emilia Plater were settled here.<br>
            Set in beautiful countryside, with lakes and mountains nearby, you will find much to please everyone. Would you like to visit the medieval Czocha Castle, also once home to the German intelligence, the Abwehr? Swim in the lakes Złotnicki, Witka, or in the Berzdorfer See where you can relax on the popular sandy beaches?  Visit Bautzen and explore the unique Sorbian heritage of Upper Lusatia? Or maybe you would like to enjoy bohemian Prague or the world class museums of Dresden? They are all nearby. In winter you can go cross country or downhill skiing (cable cars and ski lifts) in Karpacz, Swieradow Zdroj, Szklarska Poreba, or on Olympic slopes in Liberec.<br>
            If you like we can provide local guides and transport. We can also arrange transport to and from Berlin, Dresden, Prague or Wroclaw airports, or from our local train station in Görlitz.
